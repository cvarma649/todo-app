This a Todo App I made along a Youtube video. 
But I had to write a lot of my code on my own because the "windows.location" commands were not working through my WSL2 set up.

It was the first time I wrote my code myself. 
For triggering all todos(state) after having submitted the input form and list them, I had to manage the state between three components.
I had not learnt Redux or useReducer by then. 

This is my favourite project I have ever done. Because to find a solution to my problems, I had to know what was happening, and all my concepts had to be clear.

I did it. It worked. It was the first time ever I wrote code myself.
